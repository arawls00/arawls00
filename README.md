### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**arawls00/arawls00** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on basic Java knowledge 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning loops, conditionals, and soon to be MySQL
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on API integrations 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: austin_rawls@yahoo.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-rawls-32488365/ 
- âš¡ My free time is typically spent with my wife, daughter, and nieces. My favorite hobby is golf. I love to compete! Through college my life revolved around sports. If the Arkansas Razorbacks have a sport, I'll be rooting for them!
